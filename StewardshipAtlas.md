# Stewardship Atlas

  The Stewardship Atlas is a conceptual model to create reproducible pipelines for granular provisioning of geospatial assets based on spatial sql and other computational products. There are a number of emerging data management challenges from applying big data solutions to natural resource problems.  The Steweardship Atlases characterize common user situational awareness needs based on a users roles and bundle appropriate data assets in a compact form with well known relationships. The Stewardship Atlas is a compact data package with well known fit for purpose components that are extracted largely from cloud native geospatial assets.
